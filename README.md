## Introduction

LeoMoon LightStudio (formerly known as Blender Light Studio) is the easiest, fastest and most advanced lighting system for Blender 2.8x. LeoMoon LightStudio is packed with features and the new Light Node has so many options so you can customize each light exactly the way you want.

Video below shows the options that are available per light.

## Features
* Add/Remove lights around objects
* Add multiple light profiles
* Easily switch between light profiles with a single click
* Each light has many options to customize
* All options per light can be animated
* Each light can have a different light texture
* Fastest render update while lighting
* 15 Realistic HDR light textures included
* Easy 2D manipulation of lights in the LightStudio Control Panel which translates to positioning of that light in 3D space
* Toggle a light by double clicking on it in the LightPanel
* Isolate a light by right clicking on it in the LightPanel
* Lights can be added to different renders layers
* Import/Export light profiles

## Limitations
LeoMoon LightStudio uses mesh lights and currently, EEVEE does not support mesh lights in real-time. Rendering is only supported in Cycles.

## Background HDR vs Manual Lighting
Why not use the other background HDR light plugins? That's because template based light plugins are predictable and limited. For product renders, you want lots of options and control, NOT templates! However you can create your own light profiles in LeoMoon LightStudio and import/export light profiles in different projects.

## Why Are You Selling This "Free" Plugin?
Me and some generous donors, we've been funding LightStudio so far. This plugin is getting harder to develop and we need your help.
